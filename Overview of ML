Machine Learning is the process of training a peice of software called model, to make predictions or generate content (like text,images,audio or video) from data.
Types of ML:
-> Supervised Learning
-> Unsupervised Learning
-> Reinforcement Learning
-> Generative AI

--> Supervised Learning:
          Trains the model with lots of old data and gives the prediction.
            Two types:
              --> Regression: Predicts numeric value like house prediction, distance
              --> Classification: Predicts whether it belongs to a category or not like email is spam or not. (two types: binary and multiclass)
--> UnSupervised Learning:
        Creates its own rules and identify the pattern. Commenly used technique is Clustering
--> Reinforcement: make predictions by getting rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an environment.
--> Gen AI: text to text, text to image, etc.
